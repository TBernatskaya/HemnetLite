# HemnetLite

**What's done:**
1. Fetching and displaying the list of properties from https://pastebin.com/eXqnGgCY
2. Open property details by tap on list item
3. Unit tests for a view model
4. Dependency injection
5. Basic error handling.

*Tested on simulators: iPhone8 with iOS 11.4 and iPhone11 with iOS 13.3.*

**TODO:**
1. Fix UI glitches when navigate back from details view to the list
2. Add image caching and prefetching
3. Add lazy loading for list items
4. Collection view cells might have own view models.
