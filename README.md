# HemnetLite

**What's done:**
1. Fetching and displaying the list of properties from https://pastebin.com/eXqnGgCY
2. Open property details by tap on list item
3. Unit tests for a view model
4. Dependency injection
5. Basic error handling.

*Tested on simulators: iPhone8 with iOS 11.4 and iPhone11 with iOS 13.3.*

**TODO:**
1. Add image caching and prefetching
2. Add lazy loading for list items
3. Collection view cells might have own view models
4. Introduce UI components.
